 This is Part 1 Step 6
GitHub and GitHub desktop are going to make coding our final project easier than doing the coding with another program
Using branches, each member of a team can have their own branch to work on portions of the project.
Then as pieces of the code are finished, the product owner can approve sections of code to be added or chnaged to the main code in ordere to complete the project.

Overall, using GitHub and GitHub desktop are going to help me and my project group increase prodcuitvity and in the end will make it easier to complete the project.
